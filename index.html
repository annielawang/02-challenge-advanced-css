                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Annie. A self-introduction explains who you are, what you do and what others need to know about you. You should provide a self-introduction any time you meet someone new and don't have a third party to introduce you. Offer a self-introduction when you are: Beginning an interview.Buy Copies

                    You know the scenario. It could be in an online meeting, or perhaps you are seated around a boardroom table. The meeting leader asks everyone to briefly introduce themselves. Suddenly, your brain goes into hyperdrive. What should I say about myself?
                    
                    
                    
                    You start ruminating about previous self-introductions when you got tongue-tied, when you forgot to mention something important, or worse, when you rambled on for too long. Then, you realize you’re not listening to what the others are sharing. If there was a quiz on everyone’s name, you would fail.
                    
                    The stress associated with introducing yourself is common and not without warrant. Everyone’s eyes and ears are on you. It’s easy to mess up. On the other hand, self-introductions are the most direct way to reinforce your desired personal brand. And they can be easy to do.
                    
                    The secret is using a simple framework: Present, past, and future.
